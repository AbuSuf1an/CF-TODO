# Codeforces todo List Chrome Extension

## Overview
Codeforces Todo List is a Chrome extension that lets you add Codeforces problems to your todo and view/manage them from your profile page. It provides a seamless way to bookmark problems for later review or practice.

## Features
- ‚≠ê Add any Codeforces problem to your todo directly from the problem page.
- üìã View and manage your todo list in a modal on your profile page.
- üóëÔ∏è Remove problems from your todo list.
- Data is stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` for cross-device sync.

## How It Works
- On a problem page, an "Add to todo" star button is injected next to the problem title. Clicking toggles todo status.
- On your profile page, a new "todo list" tab appears. Clicking it opens a modal listing all your saved problems, with links and remove buttons.

## File Structure
- `manifest.json`: Chrome extension manifest (v3), permissions, content scripts, and host permissions.
- `contentScriptProblem.js`: Injects the todo button on problem pages and handles add/remove logic.
- `contentScriptProfile.js`: Adds the "todo list" tab and modal to the profile page, allowing management of todo.
- `storageHelper.js`: Utility for interacting with Chrome storage for todo.
- `modal.css`: Styles for the modal and UI elements.

## Installation

2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser.

## Permissions
